# DESEencryption
This program is simple to run, and only takes two inputs from the user. The first being the 16-character hexadecimal plaintext and the second being the 16-character hexadecimal key, the program then takes these two inputs and converts them into 64-bit binary strings. The program relies on using strings for almost the entire conversion process and all the rounds because it was simpler to use strings rather than integers. The program first checks to see if the inputs are of the correct size and contain only allowed characters, such being 0 - F in hex. Once the inputs have been converted, they are transformed, rearranged, and divided for 16 rounds until a final ciphertext is obtained. More detailed notes on the step-by-step process can be found within the program itself.
